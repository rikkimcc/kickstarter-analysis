# Kickstarting with Excel

## Visualizing campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals

### The purpose is to idenfity how other campaigns compared in relation to launch dates and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Theater campaign launches are more successful during the months of May, June & July; The most successful month being May. Stay away from launching theater campaigns in December as there's almost a 50% chance of failing.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: The most successful theater campaigns (success rate greater than 70%) had a goal of $4,999 or less. The ones with a goal between $5,000 - $24,999 had almost a 50% success/fail rate. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: It was a challenge determining which months/goals were least successful due to the amount of success and fail rates coming close to 50%.   

## Results

- I can conclude May and June are the most sucessful months to launch theater campaigns. October and Decemeber are less likely to be succesful due to having the highest fail rates. 

- Theater campaigns with a goal of $4,999 or less are the most successful

- This analysis is not restricted by year or country - some of this data could be scewed by unrelated information.

- Additional tabes/graphs that could be benefitical: Types of successful campaigns that met their goal - then, drilling it down to which month per country it'd be more likely to launch a successful campaign.
